# Upcycling app idea — photo → ideas → plan (with optional mockups)

## Core concept
A mobile/PWA app that helps a user **upcycle/revive an old item** (chair, drawers, lamp, etc.) by using AI to:
- identify what the item likely is and what it’s made of
- propose makeover/upcycle ideas ranked by difficulty/cost/wow
- generate a **step-by-step DIY plan** + materials list
- optionally generate **visual mockups** of what it could look like

This is positioned as an **action plan + shopping list** tool, not just “AI image generator”.

---

## MVP user flow (fast, honest)
1) User uploads **one photo** of the item.
2) App asks 2–4 quick questions:
   - goal style: modern / rustic / coastal / mid‑century / kids / “Pinterest white”
   - tools: none / basic / power tools
   - budget: $ / $$ / $$$
   - time: 1–2 hrs / weekend / multi‑week
3) App returns:
   - **Top 3 identifications** (or “uncertain”) + user confirms
   - **10 ideas** (ranked):
     - Quick wins (paint + hardware)
     - Medium (repair + filler + paint)
     - Advanced (rebuild, reupholster, rewire)
   - A “recommended” plan with:
     - materials + quantities
     - steps
     - time + difficulty
     - safety notes

## “Pro mode”: Before → Target → Plan
Users upload:
- **Photo A:** current item
- **Photo B:** inspiration/target look (Pinterest, marketplace, etc.)

Then app outputs:
- the **differences** between A and B (paint/finish/hardware/legs/shade/etc.)
- a DIY plan and shopping list tailored to tools/budget/time
- optional: a concept **preview/mockup** of A in the style of B

### Clarifying questions (high value)
- is it solid wood or veneer?
- indoor/outdoor use?
- matte vs gloss finish?
- for lamps: wired vs battery, safety warning

---

## Optional visual generation (nice-to-have)
Generate 2–4 concept mockups:
- new paint colors
- stain options
- hardware swaps
- legs/base swap
- shade swap for lamps

Keep language honest: **“concept preview”**, not “exact outcome”.

---

## Viral loop ideas
- “Before/After concept” share card with:
  - makeover style tag (Japandi/Coastal/Industrial)
  - estimated cost/time
  - difficulty
- Poll-style sharing: “Which makeover should I do? Option A/B/C”

---

## Monetization concepts
- Free: 1 project/day (or 1–2 ideas)
- $5 one-time: 3/day + unlimited exports + save projects
- Subscription later: unlimited projects, saved library, shopping list export, new style packs

---

## Differentiation vs existing tools
Many competitors focus on **mockups only**.
Differentiation wedge: **planning + execution**:
- step-by-step plan, materials list, tool gating, safety checks
- “Aussie hardware store mode” (Bunnings-style list)
- “Resale booster” mode: value uplift estimate + listing copy generator

---

## Notes / risks
- Safety: include clear warnings for electrical/structural/lead paint.
- Value estimates: provide **ranges**, ask for location, or show relative uplift rather than absolute certainty.
