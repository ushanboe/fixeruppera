# Mockup Generation Settings
# Provider: "stability" (recommended) or "dalle"
# stability = image-to-image preserves furniture structure, cheaper
# dalle = text-to-image generates new furniture, more expensive
MOCKUP_PROVIDER=stability

# Image Strength (for Stability AI only)
# How much to change the image: 0.20-0.35 recommended for furniture refinishing
# 0.20 = minimal changes, maximum structure preservation
# 0.30 = balanced (recommended)
# 0.35 = more dramatic changes
# 0.50+ = significant changes, may alter furniture structure
IMAGE_STRENGTH=0.30
